START[voting]
//This example illustrates usage of comments
  In chosoc there are only multiline comments.
  You start a comment with "//" symbols and 
  a command separator (!important!) and end
  a comment with "\\" and a command separator.
  If command separator isn't present, some
  error could happen!
  
  Also a comment should contain one or more
  command separators
  
  It's also important that no comment can be
  placed before "START" command
